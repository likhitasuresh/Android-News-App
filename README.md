# Android-News-App

This is an Android application which allows users to search for latest news provided by Guardian News, look at detailed information about these headlines, bookmark them and share on Twitter. This project is essentially an extension to the react news app I developed: <a href="https://github.com/likhitasuresh/React-News-App">Link to project</a>. There are two main additional features in this app- to display weather information for current location and to plot frequency vs year charts for specific keywords.
